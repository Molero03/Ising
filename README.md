# Ising Model

This project consist of a simulation of the 2D Ising model with periodic boundary conditions. The program create a .gif file that shows the time evolution of the system for a given temperature (k is proportional to 1/T). The lattice length and total number of steps can be modified. <br />

# # Some examples

Lattice with length L=32, k=4, total steps=10^4 (10 steps between frames)

Lattice with length L=64, k=4, total steps=10^5 (10^2 steps between frames)
